# Partial-Signal Mandate Skill Packs

This folder contains skill-ready documents for mandates that have useful static indicators in code but require runtime/process evidence for final pass/fail.

Structure per mandate:
- `code_static_eval/SKILL.md`: Step-by-step static code evaluation workflow.
- `runtime_evidence_intake_and_guidance/SKILL.md`: Natural-language context intake workflow plus runtime/process evidence generation guidance, including system command templates.

Mandates covered: 12
